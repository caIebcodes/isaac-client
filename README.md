<h3>notes</h3>
- setting this up will require also setting up isaac's back end, which isn't public yet. for now, the client's code is up but a lot of code is messy and needs refactoring.<br/>
- this project is pretty much abandoned. its next steps would probably be to refactor the player's so it isn't dependent on spotify's web player sdk which is limited in quality and functionality (by fetching song data blobs directly from their servers and decoding them), and reversing their private api to achieve feature parity with their official client.
- this is up mostly for archiving reasons :)
